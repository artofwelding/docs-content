[Console](app/dev_tools#/console) lets you run requests to Elasticsearch's APIs and view the responses. Its auto-complete, request history and contextual links to API documentation make Console a very handy tool to interact with data from your project.


## Write requests

Console understands commands in a cURL-like syntax. For example, the following is a GET request to the Elasticsearch _search_ API.

```sh
GET /_search
{
 "query": {
   "match_all": {}
 }
}
```

Here is the equivalent command in cURL:

```sh
curl "${ES_URL}/_search" \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d'
{
 "query": {
   "match_all": {}
 }
}'
```

    When you paste a cURL command into **Console**, it automatically converts to **Console** syntax. You can also export **Console** commands as cURL and run them outside of **Console**, provided that you add an API key to authenticate the request.

Console defaults requests to Elasticsearch APIs, but you can also send requests to Management APIs. To do that, prefix the path with `kbn:`. For example, `POST kbn:api/saved_objects/_export`.

## Autocomplete

When you're typing a command, **Console** makes context-sensitive suggestions. These suggestions show you the parameters for each API and speed up your typing. You can edit your preferences for autocomplete in the console settings.

## API documentation

To view the documentation for an API endpoint, select the action icon, then select **Open documentation**.

## Comments

You can write comments or temporarily disable parts of a request by using double forward slashes (`//`) or pound (`#`) signs to create single-line comments.

You can also use a forward slash followed by an asterisk (`/*`) to mark the beginning of multi-line comments. An asterisk followed by a forward slash (`*/`) marks the end.

## Variables

Console lets you create variables that are specific to your project. You can include them in the path and body of your requests as many times as you need using the `${variableName}` syntax.

## Auto-formatting

Auto-formatting helps you format requests. Select one or more requests you want to format, select the action icon, and then select **Auto indent**.

<DocCallOut color="success" title="">
    When you **Auto indent** a request that is already well formatted, **Console** collapses the request body to a single line per document. This is helpful when working with Elasticsearch [bulk APIs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.12/docs-bulk.html).

## Run requests

Submit requests using the play button.

You can select multiple requests and submit them together. **Console** sends the requests to Elasticsearch one by one and shows the output in the response pane. Submitting multiple requests is helpful when you're debugging an issue or trying query combinations in multiple scenarios.

## Get your request history

**Console** keeps a list of the last 500 requests successfully executed under **History**. When you select a request and select **Apply**, it is added to the editor at the current position of the cursor.

## Configure Console settings

In **Settings**, configure the font size, JSON syntax, and autocomplete suggestions of **Console**.
