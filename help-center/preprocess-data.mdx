[Ingest pipelines](app/management/ingest/ingest_pipelines) transform, enrich, and modify documents before they are indexed into Elasticsearch, 
allowing you to preprocess your data in a flexible and scalable manner.

## How does it work?

Ingest pipelines are defined in Elasticsearch and include a series of configurable tasks called processors. Each processor performs an operation on 
the document. For example, a processor can parse, enrich, filter, or modify the document. When you ingest a document into Elasticsearch, the document passes through the ingest pipeline, then
each processor is sequentially applied to the document. 

Processors perform the following operations:

- Enrichment &mdash; Add additional information from external data sources, such as another index or external database
- Transformation &mdash; Extract and raname fields, convert data types, remove or add fields, and more
- Filtering &mdash; Specify conditions for processing the documents, which allow you to control the transformed or enriched documents
- Pipeline handling &mdash; Manage the flow of documents through the pipeline and perform specified actions 
- Array/JSON handling &mdash; Manipulate arrays and JSON objects in documents with structured data formats

For more information, check [Processor reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/processors.html#ingest-processors-categories). 

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
Map your custom data to Elastic Common Schema (ECS), making it easier to search your data and reuse visualizations from other data sets. 
When you create a pipeline, select **New pipeline from CSV**. For more information, check [Map custom data to ECS](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-converting.html).

## Test pipelines

Before you use ingest pipelines in production, test them using sample documents.

1. Create or edit a pipeline.
1. Click **Add documents**.
1. On the **Documents** tab, add the sample documents. 
1. Click **Run the pipeline**.

## Add a pipeline to an indexing request

Use the `pipeline` query parameter to apply a pipeline to documents in 
[individual or bulk requests](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ingest.html#add-pipeline-to-indexing-request)
