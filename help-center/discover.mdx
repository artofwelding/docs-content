**Discover** enables you to quickly search and filter your data, get information
about the structure of the fields, and display your findings in a visualization.
You can also customize and save your searches and place them on a dashboard.
This article shows you how to use Discover to understand your data better.

## Explore and search your data

Select the data you want to explore. You need to create a data view from your
Elasticsearch data to access it through Kibana.

<DocCallOut color="success" title="Data view">
A data view can point to one or more indices, data streams, or index aliases to
represent your Elasticsearch data based on the requirements you define. For
example, a data view can point to your log data from yesterday, or all indices
that contain your data.
</DocCallOut>

Adjust the time range to fit your requirements. If your data is not
time-based, range selection is not available.

To view the count of documents for a given time in the specified range,
select the corresponding part of the chart.


### Explore fields

Discover includes a table that shows all the documents that match your search.
By default, the document table includes a column for the time field and a column
that lists all other fields in the document.

You can modify the document table to display your fields of interest. Use the
sidebar search field to search for the field names you are interested in. The 
**Available fields** section contains the fields that match the search criteria.
Click <DocIcon type="plusInCircle" title="Add field as column icon" /> to toggle
the field into the document table. You can also drag the field from the
**Available fields** list into the document table.
