**Discover** enables you to quickly search and filter your data, get information
about the structure of the fields, and display your findings in a visualization.
You can also customize and save your searches and place them on a dashboard.
This article shows you how to use Discover to understand your data better. You
will learn how to:

* select data views
* explore your fields
* define runtime fields
* search and filter your data
* visualize field values

You can also take a guided tour about Discover on the UI by clicking
**Take the tour** under the **Get the best look at your search results**
section.


## Explore and search your data

### Select or create a data view

Select the data you want to explore. You need to create a data view from your
Elasticsearch data to access it through Discover.

<DocCallOut color="success" title="Data view">
A data view can point to one or more indices, data streams, or index aliases to
represent your Elasticsearch data based on the requirements you define. For
example, a data view can point to your log data from yesterday, or all indices
that contain your data.
</DocCallOut>

Adjust the time range to fit your requirements. If your data is not
time-based, range selection is not available.

To view the count of documents for a given time in the specified range,
select the corresponding part of the chart.


### Explore fields

Discover includes a table that shows all the documents that match your search.
By default, the document table includes a column for the time field and a column
that lists all other fields in the document.

You can modify the document table to display your fields of interest. Use the
sidebar search field to search for the field names you are interested in.

The **Available fields** section contains the fields that match the search
criteria. Click <DocIcon type="plusInCircle" title="Add field as column icon" />
to toggle the field into the document table. You can also drag the field from
the **Available fields** list into the document table.

You can rearrange the table columns by clicking a column header and selecting
**Move left** or **Move right**. To copy the name or values in a column to the
clipboard, click the column header and select the desired **Copy** option.


### Add runtime fields to your data view

You can add a runtime field to your data view from inside of **Discover**, and
then use that field for analysis and visualizations, the same way you do with
other fields.

Click **Add a field** to create a new field. You can deinfe its type, set a
custom description and label. You can also set its value by using the Painless
scripting language.

For example, the following script creates a field with a value that combines
customer last name and first initial:

```
String str = doc['customer_first_name.keyword'].value;
char ch1 = str.charAt(0);
emit(doc['customer_last_name.keyword'].value + ", " + ch1);
```


### Search and filter

Discover combines the power of free text search with filtering capabilities
based on structured data. To search all fields, enter a simple string in the
query bar.

To search particular fields and build more complex queries, use the
[Kibana Query language](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/kuery-query.html).

Whereas the query defines the set of documents you are interested in, filters
enable you to zero in on subsets of those documents. You can filter results to
include or exclude specific fields, filter for a value in a range, and more.

Click <DocIcon type="plusInCircleFilled" title="Add filter" /> next to the query
bar to configure a filter.


### Visualize field values

If the values of a field can be aggregated, you can visualize it from Discover.
Find the field in the side bar and click its name to open a popup with
statistical details about the field values. Click **Visualize** at the bottom of
the popup to create a visualization best suited for the field based on its
values.

If you visualize geo point fields, your data appears in a map.
