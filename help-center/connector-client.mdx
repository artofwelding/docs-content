_Connectors_ sync data from an original data source to ((es)).
Use them to create searchable mirrors of your third-party data.
Connectors are written in Python and the source code is available in the [`elastic/connectors`](https://github.com/elastic/connectors/tree/main/connectors/sources) repo.

_Connector clients_ are **self-managed** connectors.
To use them, you must run the **connector service** on your own infrastructure.

Use this guide to learn how to:

- Set up a connector in your ((es)) project
- Run the connector service with Docker

## Available connectors

Connector clients are available for the following third-party data sources:

<DocCallOut color="warning" title="Data source prerequisites">
Each data source has specific prerequisites to authorize the connector to access its data.
For example, certain data sources may need you to create an OAuth application, or create a service account.
You'll need to check the [individual connector documentation](#available-connectors) for these details.
</DocCallOut>

## Create an API key

The connector service needs an API key to authenticate with ((es)).
If you already have one you're good to go.
If not, you can create a key in your ((es)) project.

In the search field in the global header, search for **API keys**, then follow the instructions.
Copy the `encoded` value of the API key, which you'll need in the next steps.

## Initial setup

In the main menu, click ** Connectors**.
Follow these steps:

1. Select **Create connector**.
2. To choose a third-party service, select the **Connector type**.
3. Add a **name** and _optional_ description to identify the connector.
4. Copy the `connector_id`, `service_type`, and `elasticsearch.host` values.
You'll need to update these values in your `config.yml` file later.

Now you're ready to run the connector service so your connector can talk to your ((es)) instance.

## Run connector service with Docker

To run the connector service with Docker, you'll be working in your terminal.

Follow these steps.

1. In the `connectors-config` directory, create a `config.yml` file.

Run the following commands:

```shell
mkdir connectors-config && cd connectors-config 
touch config.yml
```
2.  Add the configuration settings.

Copy the following configuration file template into your `config.yml` file:

```yaml
elasticsearch.host: <ELASTICSEARCH_HOST>
elasticsearch.api_key: <ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY>

connectors:
  -
    connector_id: <CONNECTOR_ID>
    service_type: <SERVICE_TYPE> # sharepoint_online (example)
    api_key: <CONNECTOR_API_KEY> # Optional. If not provided, the connector will use the elasticsearch.api_key instead
```

Replace the placeholders with the `connector_id`, `service_type`, and `elasticsearch.host` values.
Refer to our [example config file](https://github.com/elastic/connectors/blob/main/config.yml.example) if needed.

3. Run the Docker image.

Use the following command, replacing `{version}` with a specific version number, such as `8.14.0`:

```shell
docker run \
-v ~/connectors-config:/config \
--network "elastic" \
--tty \
--rm \
docker.elastic.co/enterprise-search/elastic-connectors:{version}.0 \
/app/bin/elastic-ingest \
-c /config/config.yml
```

Find all available Docker images and version numbers in the [official Elastic Docker registry](https://www.docker.elastic.co/r/enterprise-search/elastic-connectors).

<DocCallOut title="ðŸ§° Run from source">
  If you're comfortable working with Python and want to quickly iterate locally, you can run the connector service from source.
  Refer to the [docs](https://docs.elastic.co/serverless/elasticsearch/ingest-data-through-integrations-connector-client#run-from-source) for details.
</DocCallOut>

## Enter data source details

Once the connector service is running, finalize the connector configuration in your ((es)) project.
The **Configure your connector** step should now be available.

Here you need to add the specific connection details about your data source instance, such as URLs, authorization credentials, etc.
Remember, these **details vary** by data source.

## Connect to an index

After entering the data source details, connect to an ((es)) index.
This is the final step before you can run a sync.
The simplest option is to create a *new index* for your connector's data.

<DocCallOut color= "warning" title="Using existing index">
  Syncing data to an existing index is more complex than using a new index.
  You'll need to ensure **mappings** are defined for the incoming data. 
  If not done correctly, syncs will fail.
