[Ingest pipelines](app/management/ingest/ingest_pipelines) let you perform common transformations on your data before indexing.
For example, remove fields, extract values from text, and enrich your data.

## How does it work?

Ingest pipelines are a series of configurable tasks called processors that are executed sequentially to incoming data.
Each processor works from the incoming data output of the previous processes. The modified documents are indexed into Elasticsearch after 
all processors are applied.

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
Map your custom data to Elastic Common Schema (ECS), making it easier to search data and reuse visualizations from other data sets. 
When you create a pipeline, select **New pipeline from CSV**. To get started, check [Map custom data to ECS](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-converting.html).

## Test pipelines

Before you use ingest pipelines in production, test them using sample documents.

1. Create or edit a pipeline.
1. Click **Add documents**.
1. On the **Documents** tab, add the sample documents. 
1. Click **Run the pipeline**.

## Apply pipelines

When pipelines are production ready, apply them to incoming data.

You can apply pipelines:

- To [individual or bulk indexing requests](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.12/ingest.html#add-pipeline-to-indexing-request)
- As [default pipelines](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.12/index-modules.html#index-default-pipeline) for indexing requests where no pipeline is specified
- As [final pipelines](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.12/index-modules.html#index-final-pipeline) that run in addition to default or specified pipelines
