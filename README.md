This documentation uses a custom syntax written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). In many cases, you only need to know plain markdown to contribute. We'll add a public component reference and additional contribution guidelines in future. Elasticians can refer to our [internal syntax reference](https://docs.elastic.dev/docsmobile/syntax).
